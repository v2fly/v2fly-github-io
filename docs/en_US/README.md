    type: primary
features:
- title: Multiple Entries and Exits
  details: A single V2Ray process can concurrently support multiple inbound and outbound protocols, each operating independently.
- title: Customizable Routing
  details: Incoming traffic can be routed through different exits based on configuration. Easily implement traffic splitting by region or domain name to achieve optimal network performance.
- title: Multi-Protocol Support
  details: V2Ray can enable multiple protocols simultaneously, including Socks, HTTP, Shadowsocks, Trojan, Vmess, VLESS, and more. Each protocol can be configured with its own transport layer, such as TCP, mKCP, QUIC, gRPC, and WebSocket.
- title: Stealth and Security
  details: V2Ray nodes can masquerade as normal websites (HTTPS), blending their traffic with regular web traffic to avoid third-party interference, while providing packet obfuscation and replay protection features.
- title: Load Balancing
  details: Incoming traffic is automatically distributed to the most suitable exit points using probing strategies and weighted algorithms.
- title: Multi-Platform Support
  details: Native support for all common platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux, with third-party support available for mobile platforms.
