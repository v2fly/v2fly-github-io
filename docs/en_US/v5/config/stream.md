# CertificateObject

> `usage` : string

The purpose of the certificate.

* `"ENCIPHERMENT"`: The certificate is used for TLS authentication and encryption.
* `"AUTHORITY_VERIFY"`: The certificate is used to verify the remote TLS certificate. When using this option, the current certificate must be a CA certificate.
* `"AUTHORITY_VERIFY_CLIENT"`: : The certificate is used to verify the remote TLS client certificate. When using this option, the current certificate must be a CA certificate.
* `"AUTHORITY_ISSUE"`: The certificate is used to issue other certificates. When using this option, the current certificate must be a CA certificate.

> `Certificate`: string

The Certificate file in PEM format.

> `Key`: string

The Certificate private key file in PEM format.

> `certificateFile`: string

The path for the Certificate file.

> `keyFile`: string

The path for the Certificate private key file.


## uTLS
* Name: `utls`
* Type: Security Protocol
* ID: `security.utls`

uTLS is a fork of TLS aimed at trying to imitate the client hello fingerprint of popular TLS implementation to hide the client identity of a Go language program. (v5.2.0+)

It is only supports client mode and in certain transports. If you use it in a context where it is not supported,  the process will crash.

uTLS is supported in the following transports:
- TCP
- WebSocket

When you are using uTLS in some transport, the APLN will be overridden for its correct function.  It may be a slightly different fingerprint than specified.

> `tlsConfig`: [TLSConfig](#tls)

The Embedded TLS Setting for uTLS connections. Only some of its field are effective.

Supported Fields:
- Certificate Authority Settings (allowInsecure is ignored)

> `imitate`: string

The TLS client fingerprint to use for the uTLS connection.

> `noSNI`: bool

Do not send Server Name Indication in the client hello. This may result in failed connection.

> `forceAlpn` : "TRANSPORT_PREFERENCE_TAKE_PRIORITY" | "NO_ALPN" | "UTLS_PRESET"

Controls data source for Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension. You can use this setting to make connect resemble the imitated program better. In correct setting will result in connection failure. (v5.3.0+)

- `TRANSPORT_PREFERENCE_TAKE_PRIORITY` : Default value. If user have set an ALPN at TLS setting, use that. Otherwise the default from transport will be used.
- `NO_ALPN` : Do not send ALPN TLS extension.
- `UTLS_PRESET`: Use value from uTLS template.

## SocketConfigObject

```json
{
    "mark": 0,
    "tcpFastOpen": false,
    "tcpFastOpenQueueLength": 4096,
    "tproxy": "off",
    "tcpKeepAliveInterval": 0,
    "bindToDevice": "eth0",
    "mptcp": false
}
```

> `mark`: number

An integer. When its value is non-zero, mark SO_MARK on the outbound connection.

* Only applicable to Linux systems.
* Requires CAP_NET_ADMIN permission.

> `tcpFastOpen`: true | false

Whether to enable [TCP Fast Open](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E6%89%93%E5%BC%80). When its value is `true`, TFO is forcibly turned on; when its value is `false`, TFO is forcibly turned off; when this item does not exist, the system default setting is used. Can be used for inbound and outbound connections.

* Only available in the following versions (or later versions) of the operating system:
  * Windows 10 (1604)
  * Mac OS 10.11 / iOS 9
  * Linux 3.16: The system is turned on by default and no configuration is required.
  * FreeBSD 10.3

> `tcpFastOpenQueueLength`: number

[TCP Fast Open](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E6%89%93%E5%BC%80) queue length for inbound connections. Default value is `4096`. Only available in Linux.

> `tproxy`: "redirect" | "tproxy" | "off"

Whether to enable transparent proxy (only for Linux).

* `"redirect"`: Transparent proxy using Redirect mode. Only TCP/IPv4 and UDP connections are supported.
* `"tproxy"`: Use TProxy mode transparent proxy. Supports TCP and UDP connections.
* `"off"`: Turn off the transparent proxy.

Transparent proxy requires Root or CAP\_NET\_ADMIN authority.

:::tip
When `followRedirect` is specified in [Dokodemo-door](proxy/dokodemo.md) and `sockopt.tproxy` is empty, the value of `sockopt.tproxy` will be set to `"redirect"`.
:::

> `tcpKeepAliveInterval`: number

The interval in seconds between sending TCP keep-alive packets (only for Linux).

0 means keep the default value.

> `bindToDevice`: string

Bind the connection to the specified network device (Linux: v5.0.6+, Windows/Darwin: v5.2.0+).

> `mptcp`: true | false

Whether to enable Multipath TCP (only for Linux).

* `true`: MPTCP is turned on. If the host on the other side doesn't support MPTCP, MPTCP will fall back to using TCP.
* `false`: MPTCP is turned off.

When this item does not exist, the system default setting is used. Can be used for inbound and outbound connections.
