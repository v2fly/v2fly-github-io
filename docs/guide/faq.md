# FAQ

Answer to multiple weird questions

## General question

### What is the purpose of making V2Ray

People have the right to freely obtain legal information that has been disclosed. At the same time, the people also have the right to freedom of speech.

### Whether to oppose regulation

We have no objection to regulation. In fact, everything needs to be regulated to reduce the cost of living of the public, such as milk powder. But supervision needs to have laws to follow and evidence to follow. The supervision method recognized by the public is also reasonable and acceptable.

### Who will lead the development of Project V

We are a group of people who love freedom. Due to policy pressure, we tend to remain anonymous and try not to disclose any identity information.
